            &quot; What forgeries you please, marry none so rank |
            &quot; As may dishonour him, take heed of that; |
            &quot; But Sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips, |
            &quot; As are companions noted and most known |
            &quot; To youth and liberty. |
            &quot; Rey. As gaming my Lord. |
            &quot; Pol. I, or drinking, fencing, swearing, |
            &quot; Quarelling, drabbing, you may go so far. |
            &quot; Rey. My Lord, that would dishonour him. |
            &quot; Pol. Faith as you may season it in the charge. |
            &quot; You must not put another scandal on him, |
            &quot; That he is open to incontinency, |
            &quot; That's not my meaning, but breath his faults so quaintly, |
            &quot; That they may seem the taints of liberty, |
            &quot; The flash and out-break of a fiery-mind, |
            &quot; A savageness in unreclaimed blood |
            &quot; of general assault. |
            &quot; Rel. But my good Lord. |
            &quot; Pol. Wherefore should you do this? |
            &quot; Rey. I my Lord, I would know that. |
            &quot; Pol. Marry Sir, here's my drift, |
            &quot; And I believe it is a fetch of wit. |
            &quot; You laying these slight sullies on my son, |
            &quot; As 'twere a thing a little soil'd with working, |
            &quot; Mark you, your party in converse, he you would sound, |
            &quot; Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes |
            &quot; The youth you breath of guilty, be assur'd |
            &quot; He closes with you in this consequence; |
            &quot; Good sir (or so) or friend, or Gentleman, |
            &quot; According to the phrase or the addition |
            &quot; Of man and Country. |
            &quot; Rey. Very good my Lord. |
            &quot; Pol. And then Sir does he this, he does: what was I about to say? |
            &quot; By the Mass I was about to say something, |
            &quot; Where did I leave? |
            &quot; Rey. At closes in the consequence: |
            &quot; Pol. At closes in the consequence; I marry, |
            &quot; He closes thus, I know the Gentleman, |
            &quot; I saw him yesterday, or th’ other day, |
            &quot; Or then, or then, with such and such, and, as you say, |
            &quot; There was he gaming there, or took in's rowse, |
            &quot; There falling out at Tennis, or perchance |
            &quot; I saw him enter such and such a house of sale; |
            &quot; Videlicet, a Brothel, or so forth. See you now," amendedText=""/>
