            &quot; smoothly from the tongue; but if you mouth it, as many of our
            &quot; Players do, I had as lieve the Town-crier spoke my lines: nor do

            &quot; with this special observance, that you o'er-step not the modesty of
            &quot; Nature: for any thing so o're-done is from the purpose of Playing,
