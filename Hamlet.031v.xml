            '' How all occasions do inform against me,
            '' And spur my dull revenge? what is a man,
            '' If his chief good and market of his time
            '' Be but to sleep and seed? a beast, no more.
            '' Surche that made us with such large discourse,
            '' Looking before and after, gave us not
            '' That capability and God-like reason | 
            '' To fust in us unus’d: now whether it be | 
            '' Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple |
            '' Of thinking too precisely on th’ event, | 
            '' A thought which quarter’d hath but one part wisdom, | 
            '' And ever three parts coward: I do not know | 
            '' Why yet I live to say this thing’s to do, | 
            '' Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means | 
            '' To do’t: examples gross as earth exhort me, |
            '' Witness this army of such mass and charge, | 
            '' Led by delicate and tender Prince, | 
            '' Whose spirit with divine ambition pust | 
            '' Make mouths at the invisible event, | 
            '' Exposing what is mortal and unfure | 
            '' To all that fortune, death and danger dare,| 
            '' Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great | 
            '' Is not to stir without great argument, | 
            '' But greatly to find quarrel in a straw, | 
            '' When honour’s at the stake. | 
            '' How stand I then, that have a father kill’d, a mother stain’d, | 
            '' Excitements of my reason and my blood, | 
            '' And let all sleep, while to my shame I see |
            '' The imminent death of twenty thousand men, | 
            '' That for a fantsie and trick of fame Go to their graves likebeds, fight for a plot |
            '' Whereon the numbers cannot try to cause, | 
            '' Which is not tomb enough and continent | 
            '' To hide the slain? O from this forth, |
            '' My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth."
