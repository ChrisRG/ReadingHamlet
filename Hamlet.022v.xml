            Enter a King and a Queen, the Queen embracing him, and he her, he
            takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck, he lies him down 
            upon a bank of flowers, she seeing him asleep, leaves him: anon comes
            in another man, takes off his Crown, kisses it, pours poison in the 
            sleepers ears, and leaves him; the Queen returns, finds the King dead, 
            makes passionate action; the poisoner with some three or four comes in 
            again, seem to condole with her, the dead body is carried away, the
            poisoner woos the Queen with gifts, she seems harsh a while, but in
