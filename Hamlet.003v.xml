            &quot; Now follows that you know young Fortinbrass, |
            &quot; Holding a weak supposal of our worth, |
            &quot; Or thinking by our late dear brothers death |
            &quot; Our state to be dis-joynt, and out of frame, |
            &quot; Colleagued with this dream of his advantage, |
            &quot; He hath not fail'd to pester us with message, |
            &quot; Importing the surrender of those lands |
            &quot; Lost by his father, with all bands of Law, |
            &quot; To our most valiant brother. So much for him. |
            &quot; Now for our self, and for this time of meeting, |
            &quot; Thus much the business is, we have here writ |
            &quot; To Norway, Uncle of young Fortinbrass, |
            &quot; Who impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears |
            &quot; Of this his Nephews purpose, to suppress |
            &quot; His further gate herein, in that the levies, |
            &quot; The lists, and full proportions are all made |
            &quot; Out of his subjects: and we now dispatch |
            &quot; You good Cornelius, and you Voltemand, |
            &quot; Ambassadors to old Norway, |
            &quot; Who have no further personal power |
            &quot; Of Treaty with the King, more than th escope | 
            &quot; Of these delated Articles allow. |
            &quot; Farewel, and let your haste commend your duty. |
            &quot; Cor. Vo. In that and all things will we shew our duty. |
            &quot; King. We doubt it nothing: heartily farewel. |" amendedText=""/>

            &quot; You cannot speak of reason to the Dane, |
