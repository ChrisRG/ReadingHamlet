            Why does the drum come hither? | 
            Enter Fortinbrass with the Embassadours. | 
            Fort. Where is this fight? |
            Hora. What is it you would see? | 
            If ought of woe or wonder, cease your search? | 
            Fort. &quot; This quarry cries on havock: &quot; O proud death, | 
            What feast is toward in thine infernal Cell, | 
            That thou so many Princes at a shot |
            So bloodily hast strook? | 
            Embass. The fight is dismal, |
            And our affairs from England come too late, | 
            The ears are senseless that should give us hearing. | 
            To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd, | 
            That Rosencraus and Guildenstern are dead, |
            Where should we have our thanks? | 
            Hora. Not from his mouth | 
            Had it th' ability of breath to thank you, | 
            He never gave commandement for their death, | 
            But since so apt upon this bloody question | 
            You from the Pollack wars, and you from England | 
            Are here arrived, give order that that these bodies | 
            High on a stage be placed to publick view, | 
            And let me speak to th' yet unknowing world | 
            How these things came about; so shall you hear |
            Of cruel, bloody, and unnatural acts, |
            Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters, | 
            Of deaths put on by cunning, and for no cause, | 
            And in this upshot, purposes mistook, | 
            Fall'n on the inventors heads: all this can I |
            Truly deliver. | 
            Fort. Let us haste to hear it, |
            And call the nobless to the audience: | 
            For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune, |
            I have some rights of memory in this Kingdom, |
            Which now to claim my interest doth invite me. | 
            Hora. Of that I shall have also cause to speak, | 
            And from his mouth whose voice will draw no more: |
            But let this same be presently perform'd, | 
            Even while mens minds are wild, left more mischance." amendedText=""/>
