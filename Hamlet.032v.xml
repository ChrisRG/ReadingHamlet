            When sorrows come they come not single spies, | 
            But in battalians: first, her father slain, | 
            Next, your son gone, and he most violent author |
            Of his own just remove; the people muddied, | 
            Thick and unwholsome in thoughts and whispers | 
            For good Polonius death, and we have done but | 
            Obseurely to interr him; poor Ophelia | 
            Divided from her self and her fair judgment, | 
            Without which we are but pictures, or meer beasts. | 
            Last, and as much containing as all these, | 
            Her brother is in secret come from France, | 
            Feeds on this wonder, keeps himself in clouds, | 
            And wants not whispers to infect his ear | 
            With pestilent speeches of his fathers death, |

            ‘In ear and ear: O my dear Gertrard, this |
            Like to a murdering-piece in many places  | 
            Gives me superfluous death" amendedText=""/>
