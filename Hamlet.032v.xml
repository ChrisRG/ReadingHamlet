            O this is the poison of deep grief, it springs all from her fathers |

            Next, your son gone, and he most violent author |
            Of his own just remove; the people muddied, | 
            Thick and unwholsome in thoughts and whispers | 
            For good Polonius death, and we have done but | 
            Obscurely to interr him; poor Ophelia | 
            Divided from her self and her fair judgment, | 
            Without which we are but pictures, or meer beasts. | 
            Last, and as much containing as all these, | 
            Her brother is in secret come from France, | 
            Feeds on this wonder, keeps himself in clouds, | 
            And wants not whispers to infect his ear | 
            With pestilent speeches of his fathers death, | 
            &quot; Wherein necessity of mater beggerd | 
            &quot; Will nothing slick our person to arraign | 
            &quot; In ear and ear: &quot; O my dear Gertrard, this |
            Like to a murdering-piece in many places  |
