            &quot; Grief joy, joy griefs on slender accident. |
            This world is not for aye, nor is it strange, |
            That even our loves should with our fortunes change: |
            For- 'tis a question left us yet to prove, |
            Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love. |
            &quot; The great man down, you mark his favourite flies, |
            &quot; The poor advancâ€™d makes friends of enemies: |
            &quot; And hitherto doth love on fortune tend, |
            &quot; For who not needs shall never lack a friend, |
            &quot; And who in want a hollow friend doth try, |
            &quot; Directly seasons him his enemy. |
            &quot; But orderly to end where I begun, |
            &quot; Our wills and fates do so contrary run, |
            &quot; That our devices still are overthrown: |
