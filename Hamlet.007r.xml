            &quot; Virtue it self scapes not calumnious strokes; |
            &quot; The canker galls the infant of the Spring |
            &quot; Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd, |
            &quot; And in the morn and liquid dew of youth |
            &quot; Contagious blastments are most imminent. |
            &quot; Be wary then, best safety lies in fear, |

            &quot; There, my blessing with thee, |
            &quot; And these few precepts in thy memory |
            &quot; Look thou character: Give thy thoughts no tongue, |
            &quot; Nor any unproportion'd thought his act: |
            &quot; Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar: |
            &quot; Those friends thou hast and their adoption tried, |
            &quot; Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel,
            &quot; But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
            &quot; Of each new hatch't, unfledg'd courage: beware |
            &quot; Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in, |
            &quot; Bear't that th' opposer may beware of thee: |
            &quot; Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice; |
            &quot; Take each mans censure, but reserve thy judgement: |
            &quot; Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, |
            &quot; But not exprest in fancy; rich, nor gaudy; |
            &quot; For the apparel oft proclaims the man, |
            &quot; And they in France of the best rank and station, |
            &quot; Are of a most select and generous, chief in that: |
            &quot; Neither a borrower nor a lender bey, |
            &quot; For love oft loses both it self and friend, |
            &quot; And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry."
