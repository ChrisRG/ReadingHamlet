            To give the world assurance of a man: |
            This was your husband. Look you now what follows, |
            Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear |
            Blasting his wholsome brother: have you eyes? |
            Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed, |
            And batten on this moor? ha! have you eyes? |
            You cannot call it love, for at your age |
            The heyday of the blood is tame, it's humble, |
            And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment |
            Would step from this to this? sense sure you have, |
            Else could you not have motion, but sure that sense |
            Is apoplext, for madness would not err, |
            Nor sense to extasie was ne'er so thrall'd, |
            But it reserv'd some quantity of choice |
            To serve in such a difference: &quot; what Devil was 't |
            &quot; That thus hath couzen'd you at hodman-blind? |
            &quot; Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight, |
            &quot; Ears without hands, or eyes, smelling sans all, |
            &quot; Or but a sickly part of one true sense |
            &quot; Could not so mope, &quot; Oh shame! where is thy blush? |
            Rebellious hell, |
            If thou canst mutine in a Matron's bones |
            To flaming youth, let virtue be as wax |
            And melt in her own fire, proclaim no shame |
            When the compulsive ardure gives the charge, |
            Since frost itself as actively doth burn, |
            And reason pardons will."
